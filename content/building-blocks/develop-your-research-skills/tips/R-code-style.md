### R
We follow the general guidelines in [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).

Exceptions:
* We do not follow their naming conventions (don't use dots, and underscores or camel-case are fine).
* See [conventions for line length](https://github.com/tilburgsciencehub/onboard/wiki/Code#keep-it-short)
* We do not require that all functions have a comment block describing their uses, though these are encouraged when the purpose of a function would not be clear or where it will be used outside of the file in which it is defined.
