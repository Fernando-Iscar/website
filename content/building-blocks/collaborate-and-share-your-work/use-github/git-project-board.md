## Use Sprints and GitHub "Projects" to board to organize your projects.

Projects boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work using the Scrum framework for project management. The benefit from project boards is that you can link your repositories. This way all issues that are related to different projects can be organized in a unique project board.

### Get Started with Github Projects
- On your profile page on GitHub, you can find a tab “Projects” that enables you to view all your current projects board and make a “New Project”, for instance:

  ![Projects](../projects.png)

- Provide a name and a description for your project

- Set “Basic Kanban” as your project board template:

  ![kanban](../basicKanban.png)

  The “Basic Kanban” template ensures that you have almost all necessary columns to work using the Scrum framework.

- Link the repositories that are associated with your project. You can always add repositories to your project later on.  

- After creating the project board,ensure that you  **add the “Backlog” column**.

 Share your project board with your team members. Click on settings to add collaborators. Give these collaborators admin rights so that they can create issues, rename issues and prioritize issues as you go along.

**Before the meeting**
- Ensure that all the issues that are completed are moved to the “Done” section.

- If you have a follow-up question/tasks on an issue you have moved to “Done”, make sure to add a comment to that issue. This can be done by clicking on the issue and on the button “Go to issue for full details” that appears in the right column of your screen.

- Close any issues that have no further follow-up questions. Do not archive the issue, yet!

 - Make sure that you know the status of all the issues you have moved to the “In Progress” section.

**During the meeting**

  - The issues that are set to “Done” should be discussed first.

  -  Then discuss the issues set to “In Progress” and “To Do”. Make a quick note of any relevant tasks that are discussed during the meeting in the “Backlog” section. You will revise these quick notes after the meeting.

  - Together with the team members, discuss which issues from the "Backlog" should be worked on during the next sprint.

**After the meeting**

  - Move all the issues that are set to “Done” and require further discussion to be done. Make sure you add notes that specify the follow-up tasks you need to complete.

  - Archive all the issues that are set to “Done” and do not require further attention.

  - Rewrite all the quick notes you have taken during the meetings, transform them into issues, and link the associated repository to the issue. Be thorough in renaming the issues so that you understand what needs to be done. If necessary, break the note down into smaller issues. You could also categorize all your issues with labels to better manage the project.

  - Move the issues you need to work on during the upcoming sprint into the “To Do” section (either the follow-up actions, or new items from the "Backlog").

  - Prioritize the issues by dragging them up or down the list.
