## Overview

Research Cloud is a highly customizable cloud solution for conducting your research. Think of it as a “free” version of Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure machine, but then brought to you under the Dutch National e-Infrastructure.

 -  **What can you do with it?**
 Start virtual computers that run R or Python, attach some storage space, and share these computers with co-authors.

 -  **The benefits?** As a project leader:

    -  You are in charge of the IT infrastructure.

    -  Decide what packages are installed. Make sure that your coauthors can focus on doing their research, rather than installing packages or coping with memory problems on their laptops.

    - Research Cloud is also beneficial if you just want to work on a project on your own, by the way…

At present, SURF offers year-long “start-up” grants, which can then be renewed based on usage and feedback. For longer-term projects, they also offer the option to apply to [NWO grants](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/computing-time-national-computer-facilities-2021) that focus on computing resources.

## How to get started

{{% warning %}}
 1 - Check that you’re affiliated with a Dutch research institution to set up the workspace for yourself.

2 - Fill in the project [application form](https://www.surf.nl/en/research-ict/apply-for-access-to-compute-services). Select “small application”.

3 - Once your wallet is approved, you will receive an email from SURF to set up your initial workspace. This will look like this:

  ![surf mail](../surf_mail.png)

4 - After setting up the initial workspace, access it [here](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/).

5 - Detailed instructions to operate Research Cloud (including adding data sources) are [here](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/How+to+get+on+board).

## Advanced use cases

### Adding collaborators
To give students/collaborators access to a VM you have already created, you can [invite into your CO](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SRAM/Invite+CO+admins+and+members) (collaborative organization) in [SRAM](https://sbs.sram.surf.nl/):

Once they become a member of your CO they can:

 -  Log in to the Research Cloud portal.
 -  Set up TOTP.
 -  See the workspaces that you have started for the CO.

**Usage of Research Drive in combination with Research Cloud**

The Dutch foundation SURF offers login via SurfConext, which is an easy way to keep things consistent. While this works for Research Drive which is operated by LIS <link here>, it is not yet enabled for Research Cloud. Therefore, one would need to create a separate account through eduID (step 4 under “logging in” [here](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/How+to+get+on+board)).
